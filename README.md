# Vote2Cap-DETR-master-rtencoder
This project builds on "End-to-End 3D Dense Captioning with Vote2Cap-DETR" and "Vote2Cap-DETR++." It replaces the original encoder with an encoder similar to the one in RT-DETR.

This project achieved a better mAP@0.5 score (0.548788011) during the pretraining phase. However, unfortunately, its performance during the training phase was not as satisfactory.
